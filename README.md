## Hi There, Mario Here
I'm a software developer in formation at TecNMX: ITE, currently in the senior phase of my program. Iâ€™m always seeking ways to improve both my soft and hard skills. I believe there's no such thing as too much knowledge!

## Career Highlights
Learning new technologies and getting to work with other people is always a big experience to learn from. The following are the teams, projects and roles I've been involved with.

### Scientific Research Participation
Learning new technologies and collaborating with others are always great opportunities for growth. Here are some of the teams, projects, and roles I've been involved with:

At TecNMX: ITE, I had the opportunity to get involved in two research projects through a teacherâ€™s recommendation.

-   **Project 1**: I helped refactor a Windows Forms/SQL Server project plagued by data flow issues and poor database normalization. My main contribution was integrating **Dapper** as a micro-ORM to solve performance bottlenecks and improve maintainability.
    
-   **Project 2**: This project focused on **Python/SQLite**, and I collaborated with a hardware development team. It involved version control using GitHub and required a basic understanding of microcontrollers and electronics. This was an excellent chance to build my communication skills and expand my knowledge in the hardware domain.
    

After my active participation in these projects, I took on a **leadership role** in training and guiding a new team of developers.

### Feria del Libro (at ITE)
As part of a public am promotional event from TecNMX: ITE's, me and my teammates, got to know the research department, as well as the name of the career I'm enrolled to (Computational Systems Engineer) in a stand on Feria Del Libro-2024.


## Professional Experience

### Machining Network (June 2023 â€“ Present)

Currently, I am part of the **software development team** at Machining Network, working with international clients to innovate in the field of **Industry 4.0**. My team and I focus on integrating **AI**, **vision systems**, and improving **operational efficiency** for the industrial market.

## New Knowledge Is Always Something Good
Iâ€™m passionate about staying up-to-date with both emerging and established technologies. Below are some certifications and courses Iâ€™ve completed:

-   **ProgramaciÃ³n Orientada a Objetos Avanzada en C#**
-   **Universidad React: De 0 a Master**
-   **[Finanzas para JÃ³venes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Db9-dtrDUM6zEL5crdiW8vIe0RwnLPaA/view?usp=drive_link)**

I am always exploring new ways to improve my technical and soft skills!
